# KUET_IT_PARK
A 3D scene of KUET IT Park was designed and implemented using OpenGL. The project involved the creation of a virtual environment of the IT Park with
realistic textures and lighting effects. The project was developed using the C++ programming language and various OpenGL libraries were utilized to 
achieve the desired functionality. Some of the key features of the project included realistic modeling of the IT Park buildings, dynamic lighting, 
and user interaction with the virtual environment.
